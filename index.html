In my first assignment I uploaded an arduino code to the arduino & with the right code i was able to use 2 potentiometers on the breadboard to control the pitch & gain of the synth & was able to match both of the frequencies that were heard in the max patch.

for my second assignment I had synthesis coming out of the speakers. I had 4 perimeters split up in two sections on the bread board. (grain 1 and grain 2). The first potentiometer on the left would be controlling the pitch and the other pentameter would be controlling the decay. This was the set up in both grains. On the bread board I also had a piezo  that would act as a barrier to the synthesis when touched, but when my finger was released the synthesis would come back.

for my third assignment I uploaded an arduino code to my arduio. This was an upgrade to what I was doing in my first task as I used the same arduino code but took a different approach to the manipulation of the synthesis. i had additive synthesis that was coming out of the ,maxpatch which was controlled by three potentiometers, which all had different uses in the maxpatch. With the first potentiometerI was able to change the frequency of a note being played. With the 2nd potentiometer I was able to change the partial on the max patch. With the 3rd potentiometer I was able to control the duration of the synthesis and the speed in which the sound was triggered. As well as this I had an envelope on the maxpatch (ADSR) which allowed me to manipulate and change the actual synthesis of the note.
